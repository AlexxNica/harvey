This is Plan 9 for amd64 built with gcc (and soon, I hope, clang).

GERRIT
======

We use gerrithub.io for code-review. If you want to submit changes, go to https://review.gerrithub.io/#/admin/projects/elbing/harvey and check out the repository from gerrithub rather than github.

Once you've checked out the repo, you'll need to run a few commands inside the top-level directory to get set up for code-review:

curl -Lo .git/hooks/commit-msg http://review.gerrithub.io/tools/hooks/commit-msg
chmod u+x .git/hooks/commit-msg
git config remote.origin.push HEAD:refs/for/master

Now, when you've made a change you want reviewed, simply commit and push. This will generate a code-review change request, others will review it, and if it looks good we will merge it to the mainline repo.

More information on using Gerrit can be found on the gerrithub.io website.
